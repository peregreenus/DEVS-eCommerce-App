        Our team&apos;s success was the result of effective collaboration. <br />
        We held bi-daily &ldquo;meat-ups&rdquo; on messenger to discuss the project, plan
        collectively, and assign tasks to each member. This regular communication and clear task
        division kept us aligned, motivated, and ensured a successful project outcome!
