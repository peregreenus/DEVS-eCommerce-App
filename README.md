# eCommerce-Application üõí

## Introduction üìö

This is a learning project aimed at understanding and implementing a web application using CommerceTools. The project focuses on building a scalable and maintainable codebase, with a clear and organized folder structure.

## Project Goals üéØ

The main goals of this project are:

- Gain experience working with **CommerceTools** and **React**
- Apply the knowledge gained in the course
- Understand the nuances of working with Git and Github in a team development environment
- Develop hard skills
- Develop soft skills

## Technology Stack üíª

This project is built with:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **Webpack**: A static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications.
- **HTML**: The standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
- **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML or XML.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.
- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it.
- **Husky**: A tool that makes Git hooks easy, used for enforcing checks before code is committed.
- **Jest**: A delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
- **@testing-library/react**: A very light-weight solution for testing React components.

## Instructions

**1. Clone the repo**

```sh
  git clone https://github.com/peregreenus/DEVS-eCommerce-App.git
```

**2. Install Dependencies**

```sh
  cd devs-ecommerce-app
  npm install
```

**3. Run Project**

```sh
  npm start
```

The project should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Available Scripts üõ†Ô∏è

#### After `npm install`, in the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. We use **Jest** as our testing framework.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

#### `npm run lint`

Runs **ESLint** to identify and report on patterns found in TypeScript code.

#### `npm run prettier`

Runs **Prettier** to enforce a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it.

#### `npm run prepare`

Runs **Husky** to set up Git hooks and enforce checks before code is committed.

#### `npm run coverage`

Generate a code coverage report for your JavaScript code.

_Remember to replace `npm` with `yarn` if you are using Yarn as your package manager._
